# GreekYogurtRank
Everything you need to make the smartest greek yogurt decisions.

### The Top 3

1. Fage - this greek yogurt is fantastic.  It's thick, creamy, rich, and comes in a variety of flavours and milk fat options. The quality of the milk used is very high. Fage is never runny, which I greatly appreciate.
2. President's Choice - like Fage, this greek yogurt is extremely thick and creamy.  PC brand greek yogurt is a close runner up. Pick this if you like a slightly less sour version of Fage.
3. Oikos - Oikos tastes great but is a little less viscous compared to the first two. Like come on, it's greek yogurt! It **has** to be creamy, otherwise it's plain yogurt!
